In this project, I analyzed crime data from 'data.lacity.org' from 2020 - Present.
I analyzed and plotted crime by year, and found that 2022 had by far the highest amount of documented crimes.
I looked at the top 10 most reported crimes, and found that Identity Theft is by far the most reported crime. There were five times as many Identity Theft cases reported as there were the next most common crime, which was a stolen vehicle.
I found that most crimes occured during the 12th hour of the day. So from 11 AM - 12 PM.
I also found that Area # 2 is where one is most likely to get their vehicle stolen in LA, according to the data. 
Area # 2 corresponds to the Rampart Area of LA, which is just west of Downtown.
